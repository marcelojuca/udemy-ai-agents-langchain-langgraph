## Project Steps Overview

1. Find and download the LangChain documentation as an example dataset.
2. Convert the documentation into vectors:
    - Break each page into chunks.
    - Embed the chunks.
    - Store the resulting vectors in a vector store.
3. Write a chain that:
    - Uses the vector database to retrieve relevant chunks.
    - Answers user questions based on the retrieved chunks.
4. Implement a user interface using Streamlit.
5. Integrate memory into the chat, allowing it to reference previous interactions.
6. (Optional) Leave a review for the course on Udemy.
